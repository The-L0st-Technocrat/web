The author (Omar Santos) will walk you through numerous exercises and ethical hacking concepts. If you are starting your cyber career, seeking your Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH), CompTIA PenTest+, or Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) Certification, or just interested in learning more about cyber security, this three-day training session is a great resource!
This course provides step-by-step real-life scenarios. It starts by going over passive and active recon, then dives deep into scanning, target exploitation, password attacks, web application testing, buffer overflows, wired and wireless network hacking, and post-exploitation techniques.
      You will use dozens of penetration testing tools and learn how to build your own lab!</p>
