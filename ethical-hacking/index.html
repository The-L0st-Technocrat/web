            <h2>Training Description</h2>
            <p>
              Ethical Hackers (or security penetration testers) are in high-demand! An ethical hacker finds and exploits security vulnerabilities in an organization before adversaries do. If you are starting your cybersecurity career, seeking your Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH), CompTIA PenTest+, Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) Certification, or just interested in learning more about cybersecurity, this two-day training session is a great place to start!
</p>
<p>
With live discussions, demos, whiteboard instruction, and screencasts this training course will introduce you to the basics of ethical hacking or penetration testing. No prior experience is needed. Omar Santos, best-selling security author, speaker, and Principal Engineer in the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) will introduce you to security penetration testing concepts and then walk you through real-life penetration testing scenarios.
</p>
<p>
In this training you will learn about different penetration testing methodologies. You will see first-hand how an ethical hacker performs initial reconnaissance of a victim and how to assess systems and network security controls. You will learn about different penetration testing Linux distributions, such as Kali Linux, Parrot Security, and Black Arch Linux. You will also learn how to perform network and vulnerability scanning, as well as how to exploit the vulnerabilities. You will learn how to exploit different vulnerabilities in wired and wireless networks, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), XML External Entity (XXE), Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF), file inclusion, path traversal, and many other vulnerabilities. You will also learn how to crack passwords and many other different credential-based attacks.
